"""Generate the SCI-004 phase-M3 evidence envelope and its Section 11 record.

``docs/development/sci004_mmode_design.md`` Section 14.2 freezes the phase
evidence schema; Section 11 freezes the non-gating performance record this phase
retains beside it.  This tool produces both and nothing else::

    pixi run python tools/sci004_mmode_phase3_evidence.py generate

It is the phase-M3 sibling of ``tools/sci004_mmode_phase2_evidence.py`` and keeps
that tool's discipline verbatim, because the discipline is the point rather than
the code.

**The venue.** Section 14.2: the tracked generator "executes at the globally
clean exact ``S`` checkout".  That checkout must own its Python environment.
This repository installs ``radiosim`` as an editable ``.pth`` pointing at one
working tree, so a second checkout that shares an environment silently imports
the *first* tree's source -- which, while ``S3`` production is uncommitted,
turns every phase-3 oracle green and would produce an evidence artifact
describing a run the observed tree cannot perform.  A replayer must therefore
run ``pixi install`` inside the checkout being observed.  The reproduction
record states this requirement; it is not optional advice.

**Import and validation dependencies.** The module imports only the standard
library. Generation and independent validation of retained time and frame
projections use this checkout's locked scientific environment, including NumPy,
Astropy/ERFA and the exact offline IERS data. Validation imports these packages
only when needed, disables IERS downloads, authenticates the installed table
identity and restores the caller's table and configuration after each check.

**How the timing stages are measured.** Section 11 requires ``frame``,
``sky_transform``, ``beam_transfer``, ``dense_contraction_and_synthesis`` and
``total`` to share indexed iterations, with "total time ... not smaller than the
sum of applicable named stages".  The named stages are therefore genuine
sub-intervals of one real solve rather than a separate driven pipeline: this
tool installs timing wrappers on the solver module's own stage entry points --
``build_frozen_frame``, ``build_direction_ledger``, ``build_frame_certificate``,
``build_production_transfer``, the two point sky-coefficient functions and
``contract_and_synthesize``, every one of which ``_mmode_pipeline`` calls as a
module global -- and then calls the public ``solve_mmode`` unchanged.  Nothing
in production is modified and no pipeline ordering is duplicated here, so the
record cannot drift from the solve it describes.  The wrappers are removed in a
``finally``.

**The honest backend axis.** Section 11, as the accepted honest-backend-axis and
scalar-table-kernel-exception corrections rule it: the public dense path is
backend-invariant, so every row carries ``dense_execution = numpy_host_v1``,
each fixture group measures its end-to-end series once on the NumPy row, and the
top-level ``dense_invariance`` array retains the measured bit-identity of the
three per-backend cubes as fact.  Real backend computation is retained only in
``kernel_backend_block``, and only where it exists: the routed contraction
kernel's contract covers exactly Section 5.3's four science fields, so the two
scalar-payload groups carry ``not_applicable_scalar_table`` on their JAX and
Dask rows while the polarized group carries measured stages whose
``stage_comparison`` reference is the NumPy kernel output on identical inputs.

**What the record is, and is not.** Timing values never gate CI and license
neither a speedup nor a memory or accelerator advantage; every row's
``claims_not_licensed`` says so, including the end-to-end backend execution this
phase deliberately does not perform.

Generation is atomic and no-overwrite, performance record first and evidence
last; a partial set is invalid and may not be reused.

    Section 10 names five paths, but an ``output_cases`` row is a *round-trip*
    row: Section 14.2 gives it ``read_solver_sha256`` and ``read_cube_sha256``.
    Only HDF5, UVFITS and Measurement Set have a reader that returns a cube.
    Summary JSON is metadata-only by Section 10 and RadioSim ships no summary
    reader at all, so a ``read_cube_sha256`` for it could only be the written
    digest restated -- an invented round trip.  Its Section 10 obligation is
    carried by the R3 oracle in ``tests/unit/test_io/test_result_summary.py``,
    and ``limitations`` records the boundary rather than papering over it.

    The three identity fields are Section 14.0's exact ones -- domains
    ``radiosim.mmode-result-time.v1``, ``radiosim.mmode-result-feeds.v1`` and
    ``radiosim.mmode-result-correlations.v1`` over their exact key sets -- so
    they are reconstructible from the same fixture input the phase already
    embeds.  Section 14.0 forbids inventing a preimage, and a result-shaped
    stand-in would be exactly that.
