# RadioSim completion ledger

Current programme opened 2026-09-07. This ledger records observed work and
remaining gates; it does not accept a scientific phase or supersede a design.
The user authorizes implementation on main, small commits and ordinary pushes,
prospective independently reviewed corrections, and exact-SHA historical replay
fixtures. No implementation is authored in another worktree.

## Authenticated starting state

- Primary main: `82fb0773890870a6fb90b3ed9b8065df89919a84`.
- Live remote main: `cfc9b10d655a4d9bedbd7d7750c4743f504bbaf9`.
- Main fast-forwarded to that remote tip without parking or modifying the draft.
- External recovery root:
  `/Users/kartikmandar/RadioSim-recovery/20260907-completion/`.
  Each repository bundle contains base SHA, original index, index entries,
  full-index binary patches, changed-file bytes and filesystem identities.
  Applying both patch layers in an isolated index reproduced the exact staged
  entries and final changed-file bytes/deletions for all three bundles.
- Primary unstaged patch SHA-256:
  `bc83d195be6a9d63a3945497595a16c5648eb06ec0c403e4c995966d3e5eccd3`.
- Primary staged patch SHA-256:
  `78aeebb4c4d240aba0899dba69b69db4e55506b6d6eacd826f396fd5a24a00f0`.
  Both hashes were unchanged after fast-forward. The four staged artifact
  deletions remain part of the replacement-source draft, not this ledger slice.
- D28 and D29 stopped candidates are preserved separately at their exact bases.
  They are unaccepted implementation candidates, not source authorities.
- No existing pytest, acceptance, evidence, or Sphinx process was running at
  initial process inspection.
- GitHub run `33701403760` failed at the remote tip; newer runs `33726794068`,
  `33847827991`, `33951179081`, and `34018313735` are cancelled, not successful.
  Per-job diagnosis and final exact-SHA CI remain outstanding.
- Intermediate source `cf1a976` run `34088524159` completed with lint, metadata,
  types, docs and NumPy/JAX-CPU parity successful; all six compatibility jobs
  were cancelled. This is not complete CI acceptance.

## Original draft accounting

The original nine-path draft is now parked in the verified external recovery
bundle so prerequisite red tests and small source commits use committed source.
Reversing only the authenticated five-file unstaged patch and four-file indexed
deletion patch restored all nine paths to their exact current Git blobs and left
the index/checkout clean. Every original hunk remains retained verbatim in the
bundle; both stopped candidate worktrees remain untouched.
The external `original-hunk-inventory.json` enumerates all 63 primary hunks,
32 D28-candidate hunks and 48 D29-candidate hunks (SHA-256
`f4417e47c3d6038a164cfb448b95aeaad55a9e07eb67003fa68dcae34c19c356`).
C1 must replace this provisional accounting with per-hunk dispositions
(retained, corrected, superseded with reason, or obsolete under reviewed successor
contract) before source acceptance. Whole-file copying of overlapping candidates
is not an integration method.

The external `provenance-audit/original-hunk-disposition-v2.json` now accounts
for every stopped-candidate hunk through exact `87b16ba`: 21 retained, 38
corrected and 21 superseded, each with commit/blob/locator and reason. Its
SHA-256 is `b2d6a7969469a9b42fecba09335434484f8421dd1e8a39f1a1edfaa29fc9310b`.
Primary accounting through `248f6c6` is
`provenance-audit/original-hunk-disposition-v9.json`,
SHA-256 `c86ab5b0634c45d88833e8055b4e2427314dfcc9b48956e77b91f76b62237643`.
The separately frozen `retrospective-duplicate-intent-027-052-055.json`
(SHA-256 `3d2aef754ed3d7936d770ab96ca115e50c6c977887498c68e6329718269a8c92`)
authenticates three earlier duplicate intents: 052 and 053 corrected,
054 retained. Together these records retain all 63 primary identities:
23 intents complete (11 retained, 12 corrected), and 40 remain pending at that
boundary. The separate `original-hunk-addendum-055-bef5750.json` (SHA-256
`0cab6aad058833bf0084002b37cd318d3a439aef4589f23fa36038d44229201c`)
records donor 055 corrected at `bef5750`, after `2461db4`: the explicit consumer
29/6/2 inventories and ordered passing-control joins complete its remaining
intent. Effective primary totals are now 24 complete (11 retained, 13 corrected)
and 39 pending. Donor 027's third nested reference and complete copy/source-relation
tests remain pending. All prior accounting bytes and 143 identities are preserved;
new supporting tests receive no additional donor credit. The 80 stopped-candidate dispositions
are unchanged from v2. Production-v2 commit `a39ceff` lands donors 001–006,
058 and 059; b17f63a lands corrected donor 015 and ec94dc8 lands corrected donor
034. Donor 057 remains pending as a
whole: its caller wiring landed,
but its fingerprint-row schema did not. New tests receive separate accounting.

Original E HEAD and tracked bytes/types/modes/LFS materialization checked throughout publication; final raw check follows status and exact output inventory.

Three ordered design edges, five distinct bindings, guarded frame/test paths and optional 17/18-path aggregate active. Original workflow-mode REJECT and cancelled partial run preserved; executable-mode regression fails before repair and 23 workflow controls pass afterward. No numerical repair or admission |
| Compatibility execution budget | `a18aa60d2cfcd1457d11a044c18e8ddecbdbe040`, pushed and live remote verified | Sole workflow change raises compatibility timeout from 45 to 120; exact committed byte guard, unchanged 100644 mode, full patch and landed verification-workflow role authenticated. All matrix cells, commands and other job limits remain exact; final exact-SHA compatibility acceptance remains pending |
| Frozen-bound initial partition regression | `b03258073233a9a8def68cfa71ccd4035210192c`, pushed and live remote verified | Both independent round2 reviews ACCEPT; original scanner produces exactly four intended missing-boundary failures and 14 passing controls. The separately committed S regression verifies the exact 14-boundary union, allocation extent and original owned endpoint identities; original hidden-upper-boundary REJECT retained. This is not another historical M3 red record |
| Frozen-bound initial partition repair | `aa933c24f4547a2303dd6a72f76287c1f60bd8dc`, pushed and live remote verified | Both independent source reviews ACCEPT the exact two-path patch; 35 frame cases pass on each of Python 3.11 and 3.12, and all seven public Python-3.12 integration cases pass in 1,056.18s.

Clean-source four-family measurements and a later reviewed numerical transition remain required; no observation admitted |

| Atomic D35 activation | `af8d5959ef84adbc6ec2d45203ceef2de89486dd`, pushed and live remote verified | Both independent round2 source reviews ACCEPT, with separate final gate authentication: full history 360, dependency 152, evidence 1,172 plus seven existing future-E skips; Python 3.12 activation 26 pass. Strict 756 unchanged. Five owners change atomically; complete source requires the approved repaired geometry and actual separate causal ancestry. Original round1 gate failure and reviews remain preserved |
| Direction-owned slab measure repair | `cf67c0ba27ea4a0b919f600053328d06c3d864de`, pushed and live remote verified | Exact dual-reviewed two-path patch `d5035e4957fe4bbd0bbcaeb1f1693d0d2ae140e93677f41c3473d56a16f82772`; 109 frame cases pass on both Python versions, including the five original causal failures. Scoped strict diagnostics fall from 120 to 118 with no additions. Exact Fraction unions stay in turns, per-direction ownership and canonical index order hold, and unchanged assembly converts outward once.

| Characterization receptor ownership | `4b93e7a46dc00965548d86836ef26f160ff770c2`, pushed and live remote verified | Both independent round2 source reviews ACCEPT; full serial E 1,248 passed with seven existing future-E skips in 674.04s, 25 affected controls pass on each Python version, strict 367 unchanged. Exact native floats, closed receptor schemas, ordered antenna joins, signed-zero-sensitive angle rules and four-family restrictions; reduced runtime digest remains carried, not reconstructed. Original integer-zero REJECT and interrupted run preserved; Python 3.12 full time/projection correction remains separate |

Exact input14/phase26 outer schemas, content projections, source/solver/time joins and frequency/correlation/three-time-buffer bit checks; nested physical semantics, generation and admission remain separate. Original test-causality REJECT retained; repaired extra-key controls fail decisively when their guards are disabled |
| Frame regression | `1909829d828078fd36a905aa68cde50fcb4bfa16`, pushed and live remote verified | Two controlled expected-red assertions under each Python version: mismatch count 1, not 0; no collection/import failure |

| Ledger docs fix | `c245593df808e0a757925d5a02416b4608cd8661`, pushed and live remote verified | Fresh Sphinx build fetched all inventories; explicit ledger orphan declaration restored warnings-as-errors success |
| Frame diagnosis | External `frame-investigation/REPORT.md` under recovery root | Python 3.12: 279 outside-slab mismatches become zero with installed IERS context, unchanged geometry; controlled one-interval perturbation reproduces on both Python versions |
| Draft type baseline | External `pyright-original-draft.json` under recovery root | 196 files, 2,983 errors, zero warnings; debt ceiling unchanged; this is not a clean type check |

Every later slice records its actual commit and verified push in a subsequent
journal update, avoiding self-referential commit hashes. An unexpected failing
gate stops acceptance of its affected phase; diagnosis and authorized repair
continue within this programme. Cancelled CI jobs and selected passing subsets
cannot establish final closure.

## Historical boundary after direct conformance regressions

The test-only IERS correction is pushed at `272b56d`. Its explicit function-scoped
fixture authenticates the two exact locked test resources and restores the same
cached module owner on success and interruption. Production acceptance remains
unchanged and is tested separately: the default table passes and the newer table
is rejected. Both-runtime focused gates pass 145 cases; full serial default E
passes 1,255 cases with seven unchanged future-E skips. Strict diagnostics remain
367. Original harness failures and the initial Python 3.12 limitation remain
preserved under external `c1-time-runtime-correction-candidate/round1/`.

D36 is reviewed and pushed at `7752f04`, with independent own-header and actual
parent checks. The original exported patch and actual Git patch differ only in
hunk context placement; both reconstruct identical reviewed documents. The
failed equality check and uncredited build are preserved; the subsequent strict
documentation build passed. D35 remained executable authority until the separate
atomic D36 activation, since completed at `e33fb26`. Original D35 geometry and
scientific limits are preserved.

The separate causal commit `216afb1` adds six real-owner assertion controls for
five defects: operational fringe ownership, two model-classification cases,
least-upper radius, directed accumulation and omitted inner operational root
bounds. Each Python version retains six intended failures and three passing
controls. Supplementary isolated runs bind package/solver paths and source hashes
before and after each test in the same process. These establish causal defects,
not repaired production or a measured failure of any actual-family bound.
Evidence is under external `d36-causal-candidate/round1/`, including its original
classifier stop and separately authenticated `origin-supplement/`.

At that boundary, new captures were held until the reviewed source repair and
activation gates passed; the D36 measured boundary below records their completion. The structural full-row terminal traversal has independent dual acceptance
and bounded synthetic tests; independent numerical predicates and admission
remain incomplete. Instrument/selection semantics have a reviewed finite plan,
with implementation pending and beam semantics still separate.

## Historical production-v2 verification stop at a39ceff

The committed production-v2 implementation at `a39ceff` (external
`s3-production-v2/round3/`, patch
`a52459bb45541ade89c92abc3d76d6c15fcc5612ee655acbef9749eb822d0b54`) received
both independent source reviews. Its complete evidence module passes 450 tests;
strict changed-file diagnostics introduce no new errors. The first actual
public scalar run produces the required nine-key family record, fourteen-key
input preimage and twenty-six-key same-run phase preimage. Its historical
snapshot/scientific comparison stopped; that original failure is retained.
The three remaining public-family diagnostics subsequently completed with
`novel_unadmitted` outcomes. Their exact cube, phase and time identities match
history; the restricted certificate substitution reconstructs every historical
snapshot and scientific hash. The complete run retained 279 authenticated
artifacts, including actual HDF5 results and independently rehashable scientific
preimages. All source, helper, driver and working-state checks passed. Aggregate
`unadmitted-family-diagnostic/verification.json` under the round-3 bundle hashes
to `b52742f9e9bf90c7a29d3c48e3a3214752dbea1aff0a352dd4d05ebf1ba77129`.
Both reviewers independently accepted those three causal proofs; the required
D32 append-candidate admission reviews remain separate and pending.

Both reviewers independently accepted the scalar causal diagnosis in
`frame-investigation/certificate-probe/` and `scientific-preimage-probe/`.
The phase, cube and characterization-time identities remain exact. The whole
solver-file hashes changed at `cfad247` and `efd9e92`, propagating through the
certificate's enclosure/error/ledger hashes and the existing solver field.
Substituting only authenticated historical implementation hashes reconstructs
the exact historical certificate. The complete offline scientific preimages
then reconstruct actual `03b7f62a1daaf091ea16b1caa78a0e16a481622bad8e5b78ba5af0dc2dbed45a`
and historical `a8852fd181e8f1ddd08e24e01066bcede2e1e1541fba9a067d47f0febc51c344`;
only the solver certificate field differs. The scientific-preimage artifact
manifest hashes to `f781e42488352b71d0b974b6cd67c3de026af1d01f01a955b603939bf2f0a3e8`.
These are explicitly reconstructed preimages, not another public result.

D32 and D33 now supply the independently reviewed prospective contracts.
All four expanded thirteen-field transition candidates are retained under
`d32-transition-material/`; their independent portable verification SHA-256 is
`ddaccddcfba27dc6c26e7f5979dd6cdcbc2f05779665c61cdb5f665c4bc5c7d5`.
No retained primitive is missing. The exact owner-defined EarthLocation
round trip reconciles result and frame coordinates without a tolerance change.

The expanded four-row array measures 143,135,033 bytes before ordinary evidence
and admission reviews. D33 therefore defines bounded, lossless inline storage
for only the eight certificate values, while preserving the expanded transition
digest domain. The measured canonical encoded array is 38,929,073 bytes before
ordinary evidence and reviews; the complete final artifact must still pass the
specified size guard. Transport primitives landed at `50cbf30`; full certificate,
cascade and portable admission validation remain pending. No observation has
been appended and generation remains closed. The separate committed-blob
transport verification of all eight certificates and four expanded digests is
`d33-certificate-codec/independent-actual-transport/verification.json`, SHA-256
`1d386df11026d5f5f3a06776531c292db839ed15593c9882bf4d7c1b0516b38e`.

The reproduced replacement-ref history bypass is repaired at `34fa01c`.
Its retained original exploit is `d32-history-auth-audit/probe-result.json`,
SHA-256 `8e9e8a247cd1e035b5c7470cd75e7d2aa7ce4f945a76f64ddf9424cebce05819`.
It does not establish that a retained historical record was forged.
The current-E selector landed at `ec94dc8` after 535 passing tests, seven
future-E skips and both independent ACCEPT reviews. Exact D32/D33 authority
wiring is committed. Remaining
schema/proof integration, reviewed observation admission and final disposal
precede the complete terminal-source gates and separate E/A acceptance.

The composed replay at `1d67b75` closes the later Git/Python isolation regression
gate. It does not replace terminal-S characterization, full source gates, or
fresh evidence/acceptance. Remaining nested certificate, phase/input, time/stream
joins and source-cascade validation must finish before the coupled evidence
schema cutover and observation admission. The four rejected artifacts remain
unchanged and all six approval constants remain literal `None`.

A subsequent native E-lifecycle probe found that a status clean filter can move
HEAD to another commit with the same tree before the postpublication raw check.
That implementation rediscovered HEAD and accepted the changed commit identity. The variant
that also changed tracked bytes rejected through the status inventory; the
confirmed gap is the original-source HEAD binding. The retained
`e-head-binding-audit/probe-head-only.py` and `.json` preserve the observation.
The bounded repair at `e997f97` retains the preflight source SHA through
publication and checks it before and after raw tracked authentication. Both
independent implementation reviews accept that correction after the full
863-pass/seven-skip evidence suite. No generated evidence has been accepted.

Independent terminal-scan inspection at `786413f` confirmed a separate operative
Section 12.1 violation: `frozen_root_bounds` is accepted and length-checked but
its values never enter the initial partition. All four authenticated retained
certificate/phase pairs contain 10,240 frozen-bound occurrences (5,133 distinct)
absent from the source's 4,193-boundary initial grid, across 2,560 directions.
Two source reviews found no later waiver; a separate exact-rational calculation
reproduced the counts without importing the solver or rerunning a scan.
The retained `d32-terminal-scan-feasibility/retained-boundary-comparison.json`
hash is `c8549b5e84864898459d9ad85c4257c46690d34384df08a713efb8d7c683ac6c`;
the independent root confirmation hashes to
`99ebcfbc4902866da5bc09576d597a17d24b9944bce1a73041b7ab7d8d2e7a17`.
This is an initial-partition comparison, not a new proof of the frozen roots.
Full certificate conformity and observation admission cannot advance on these
records. Reviewed D34 at `90ef12e` permits the finite numerical repair and its
separate S regression, preserving historical D32/D33 evidence and all budgets.
Exact edge authentication at `3563fa7` and guards at `0fe8be4` are composed by
activation at `505ef3d`, including the separate regression predecessor and exact
workflow modes. The optional timeout change is recorded at `a18aa60`; parent
CI `34118006232` exhausted 45 minutes in all six compatibility jobs, while
quality and parity passed. This cancellation is not compatibility acceptance.
The reviewed round6 external driver completed all four public characterization
families once at clean `e7623fb`, with exit zero, unchanged source checkpoints,
successful byte verifiers and passing returned frame certificates. Its final
inventory is `d34-measurement-driver/execution-round6/capture/final-integrity.json`,
SHA-256 `06ceb7e2faa8940ca02c1631aab0bc2f5604436210606e8a4efa29d0027c2d91`.
These are unadmitted measurements, not performance or M3 acceptance evidence.

Independent scalar and three-family comparisons confirm unchanged visibility,
flag, weight, time, frequency and channel-width arrays, unchanged phase values,
and unchanged direct certificate arrays and numerical error-preimage values.
Operational horizon bounds and counts change; the existing source-hash-only
transition therefore remains insufficient. Scalar's old scientific reconstruction
and separate certificate probe retain their original qualifications.

The independent `d34-initial-partition-proof/result.json`, SHA-256
`d1da111fcd5d540bd15209aef27548bc2b2bb729dff495be6da43f855e351805`,
checks all 9,326 actual boundaries per family against the exact required union:
4,193 base points plus 5,133 distinct frozen-root endpoints. All 753,130 retained
centre values match their initial-stream projections bitwise. The accepted bounded
terminal parser then verified the complete scalar and point-I streams. Full-Stokes
and circular reuse the point-I structural result only after independent full-file
and complete-contract byte equality. `d34-terminal-parse-current-round2/completed.json`
is SHA-256 `df521178e3ace078e1d544b049e19503be28c8d909ef1c9da824f72dbea79484`.
Structural proof does not establish celestial-coordinate values or admission.

Historical scalar reconstruction stopped at a string comparison of `0/1` with
`0`; all 4,193 exact rational values and 49 centre vectors match. Its original
execution remains failed. Separate full terminal parsing and independent retained
source/input/root/restoration joins pass; `d34-historical-scalar-postvalidation/retained-scan-proof-summary.json`
has SHA-256 `6a8619886b57a973e65e8d47e3c82e57a5885418ca1aa0ab1938b4f0e3a18934`.
Point-I, full-Stokes and circular historical scans completed under the corrected
driver. No historical job completes a certificate or solve.

The comparison exposed B4's measure-unit and ordering defects. Its preserved
`d34-slab-measure-diagnosis/result.json` is SHA-256
`8855dad281bd1d2b892a670867e582b10aa7c3ff7f9d75ba9a9b7e7fd3a2a4dd`.
The reviewed external proposal defines the exact sum of direction-owned slab
unions and one outward conversion, preserving every budget. D35 now provides the reviewed operative grant at `dd26e04`. Source correction and strict executable activation subsequently landed at `cf67c0b`
and `af8d595`. Public numerical gates, fresh corrected-source measurements,
certificate conformity and numerical transition/admission remain required; no
retained certificate is rewritten.

D35's exact two-document landing follows fresh dual ACCEPT of round 2; the
original round-1 provenance rejection and its bounded sequencing repair remain
preserved. The separate `5790241` regression completes real certificate assembly
with explicitly synthetic unrelated providers. Its five assertion failures expose
turn/radian units, pair order and exact outward conversion; the zero/ownership
control passes. Both independent reviews accept that causal inventory, not a
physical certificate. A reviewer selector also ran all 35 original frame cases,
which passed; the actual expanded inventory and selection mistake are retained.
`d35-causal-regression-candidate/manifest.json` has SHA-256
`015e70232e046d9b3051817771b9c5e575a81e8b5ae3e14d3fcc48949a881c4d`.

Preparation at `368821d` authenticates pending D35 through the unchanged full
raw-object/own-review checks and separates historical D34 consumers. It changes
neither the active three-edge registry nor current completeness or D31 bridge
rules. All 161 affected cases pass; scoped strict diagnostics remain 281, while
the causal test file retains its original 42. Both source reviews ACCEPT.
`d35-history-preparation-candidate/manifest.json` has SHA-256
`6fcdb08a498d3f815071073fd149bc691e7a639f5ca9f04c921ddb0d78b256c3`.

Read-only one-minute Slurm metadata allocations found Quadro RTX 5000 GPUs on
herapost009/herapost010 and an NVIDIA L4 on nmpost037, all with driver 555.42.06.
herapost008 was unavailable because its resources were busy; no driver was
observed there. The separate ubuntu24lts SSH connection timed out. No matching
inventory jobs remained afterward. These observations are hardware metadata,
not selected-JAX-device, locked-environment or performance proof. The transcribed
record `perf-resource-refresh-20260907/observations.json` has SHA-256
`78092dbe5b7717fae872a0217c65a9e788dfd5d1c6aac9284733cf73df73a740`.

The D35 activation completion records under
`d35-atomic-activation-candidate/round2/` authenticate all four successful serial
commands, exact source hashes before/after every gate, and the unchanged protected
numerical patch. `complete-gates-results.json` hashes to
`6a0d0ad3500454a967ee17d1f1eacfa4d7b26ce9677c95ba431d719acdd357e0`;
the independent final gate review hashes to
`bd66f82c579280ee627b32244cc87ca552548e62d1e000694d7d2b77ea8facd1`.

Both commits reproduce their complete reviewed patches, and the checkout was
clean after the geometry commit. These outcomes do not complete terminal S or M3.

C1 instrument composition is now connected to the input validator; beam,
sky/direction/transfer and convention/frame checks, then the coupled schema cutover,
remain open. D36 public gates and fresh clean-source capture are complete;
conformity and a further reviewed numerical admission relation remain open.
The bounded profile reader remains in source/construction preparation; it has not
acquired actual capture profiles or supplied numerical proof.
No whole original donor is retired by these scheduling decisions.

Read-only F1 diagnosis confirmed two catalog defects for later scoped repair:
MALS DR1 combines spectral windows with different actual frequencies while the
loader assigns one reference frequency; all four GLEAM entries select peak
`Fpwide` (Jy/beam) as integrated Jy. Independent review selects `Fintwide` in Jy
as the minimal GLEAM repair, explicitly described as the 170–231 MHz integrated
wide-image estimate used at nominal 200 MHz, with the existing spectral-index
policy. No catalog source has changed. Actual VizieR metadata resolves the
suspected MALS/LoTSS coordinate alias discrepancy. The official LoTSS DR2 MOC
omits blanked bad-facet regions, so it does not establish an exact footprint;
unknown coverage remains unchanged. Retained schemas and review records reside
in `f1-release-footprint-research/` and `f1-gleam-flux-research/`.


## D36 measured boundary and current prerequisites

Activation `e33fb26fdff39e2b3f103c8d46f132da11fcbdc7` and numerical repair
`c023036ca70871ab901471dc204f36a4d89b6c4f` are pushed. The activation passed
all six serial history/dependency/evidence gates; the numerical candidate passed
17 focused cases on each supported runtime. The subsequent public gates passed
seven integration cases and one characterization case on each runtime, with no
skips. The complete public-gate authentication is
`d36-public-gates/c023036/root-complete-auth.json`, SHA-256
`269b8a51c7ee9d006a56632da3ec65449889b4c04c428f570a3297936f018a7d`.

The existing capture process completed once, without retry, for all four families
at clean `c023036`. Its final record declares completion with no original failure
or final errors, and explicitly withholds admission. Independent streaming hashes
matched all 901 listed artifacts (7,442,685,965 bytes), exact inventory, source and
helper identities, unchanged environment records and preloaded import identities.
The root record is
`d36-measurement-driver/execution-round1/root-finished-capture-auth.json`, SHA-256
`d51f61effbd8f47b00ac826aebcb13133b5a604ae1b734970649d57efaf258da`.
This checks byte integrity and retained metadata joins; it does not independently
decode numerical payloads or prove terminal conformity. Historical captures and
failed attempts remain unchanged. Source, capture, admission and M3 acceptance
remain separate outcomes.

The M4 prerequisite review records are external under the recovery root:

- Native/direct basis round2: `m4-public-support-decisions/round2/`.
- Native convention/materialization round1: `m4-native-conventions/round1/`;

  `0d0af8158cc113a5037e3793cf8b3f5c935695cec730c815b6805bc3ada82ac5`.

These prospective decisions do not establish implemented public support or
numerical qualification. The bounded codec and finite FITPACK work recorded below
advance individual prerequisites; operational whole-cell bounds, provider internal
allocations, source grants and actual public scientific tests remain required.
The exact-`c023036` CI run
[34180339931](https://github.com/RRI-interferometry/RadioSim/actions/runs/34180339931)
ended with all six compatibility jobs cancelled after their explicit two-hour
limits. Backend-parity and quality jobs passed. Both Linux runtimes reported the
two production-v2 preimage tests FAILED before timeout; their missing terminal
tracebacks leave the cause unresolved. The incomplete macOS logs do not establish
full-suite success. The original diagnosis remains in
`ci-c023-34180339931/round1/report.md`. The recorded pending observation for
`74830bc5f30330a3bbf4124f33ef467447cf1f7c` run
[34192091050](https://github.com/RRI-interferometry/RadioSim/actions/runs/34192091050)
remains historical; no terminal result for that run is inferred here.

The serial diagnostic reporter `c0be678e362570d10d44e29c28885119d947f2d0`
and workflow `ec46f3fa536b35a02f41d3aa7981beb535eae463` initially refused both
Linux jobs before test bodies with `collection configuration drift: ini` (JUnit
zero tests). Lifecycle correction `c238b15e6cc8dc2a64b3cd7d7ee075d5ca788b7c`
passed 29 synthetic cases on each runtime. Actual run
[34196892621](https://github.com/RRI-interferometry/RadioSim/actions/runs/34196892621)
then executed both selected nodes without infrastructure refusal: Python 3.11
failed both with `InvalidResultError: invalid characterization result antennas`;
Python 3.12 passed both. The second 3.11 failure received that antenna error before
its expected identity refusal. Complete raw failures, settled configuration and
source authentication are retained under
`ci-serial-diagnostic-execution/{ec46f3f,c238b15}/round1/`. These diagnostics do
not reconstruct the missing original c023 tracebacks.

Result geometry commit `c82b56a889f8420a6c21bcae3ea136a4fd19cdd0` now reconstructs
antenna and baseline coordinates with the same complete float64 matrix operand
shapes as the producer, retaining independent result-owner reconstruction and exact
word checks. Its 60 selected cases pass on each runtime; scoped strict diagnostics
remain exactly 280. Actual Linux diagnostic run
[34200643186](https://github.com/RRI-interferometry/RadioSim/actions/runs/34200643186)
passes both exact nodes on each runtime, with no skips/errors/failures. Root
capture authentication binds 40 members and 148 unique source/config Git-blob
joins per runtime. This is targeted success, without a claim about the exact
Linux native-kernel cause or reconstruction of the original c023 failures.

The subsequent complete E unit module at exact `c82b56a` passes 1514 cases with
seven expected skips on each runtime. The seven E3 authorization skips remain
unchanged. Root records `result-geometry-linux-auth.json` and
`checkpoint8-full-e-auth.json` under `output/verification/root-continuation-20260908/`
bind these separate results. Full E unit verification does not generate E3,
admit scientific observations, complete M3 or establish broad CI closure.

The ordered CI proof kernel `cf8bf8f70faf7969734f553ed642cf163d78ee82` passes 41
infrastructure cases per runtime with zero scoped strict diagnostics, including
the required zero-node-owner control. Main collection/CLI orchestration, worker
barrier/restoration and workflow integration remain separate. Its records are in
`ci-ordered-partition-candidate/round2/`; geometry evidence is in
`ci-result-geometry-candidate/round1/`. The non-invoking request parser is now
committed and pushed as `4c39bfcd4b741de9f5e08c3777df2ffb7ace5e1f`: 72
infrastructure cases pass per runtime with zero scoped strict diagnostics. Its
196-line additive patch preserves the initial two-diagnostic typing stop under
`ci-collection-request-candidate/round1/`; final evidence is in `round2/`.
It validates request schema and raw-byte identity, not checkout/argv authority,
worker lifecycle or publication. Request-selection authority binding is now
committed and pushed as `1135f35007d625b17b4ef6611ff4165f54bafd12`.
The implementation joins the separately authenticated raw request to root,
commit, source-manifest, baseline lifecycle, exact role selection and expected
node ownership; Git authentication remains caller-owned. The original two-C408
Ruff stop is retained, and its two-constructor-only repair received independent
source acceptance before execution. The repaired static sequence passed, followed
by exactly 80 unique passing cases with no failures, errors or skips on each of
Python 3.11 and 3.12; collection observations equal both JUnit inventories and
all before/after source, index and mode boundaries. Frozen evidence manifest

collection or establish collector lifecycle, partition or CI closure.

Collector status validation is committed and pushed as
`c272f75961310c0f6878c1ce2121d0d9023c9bd6`. `collection_exit_code()`
preserves exact `int` and pytest `ExitCode` values while rejecting booleans,
foreign integer enums and coercion-bearing objects. The original scoped-Pyright
stop on the untyped test sentinel is retained; its one-line annotation repair
and the direct three-input baseline derivation received independent acceptance
before execution. The derivation controls passed 24 tests on each of Python
3.11 and 3.12. The repaired static sequence then passed with zero scoped
diagnostics, followed by exactly 95 passing cases on each runtime with no
failures, errors or skips and exact collection-observation/JUnit joins. Frozen

both local runtimes without executing actual CI collection. Round16 first-failure
gates passed the exact sequence controls-default, controls-py312, preflight,

errorCount 0 with an integer-only summary; both runtimes collected and passed

`d2485a835606158c6feb3fe650b99365ad556af2`. The 139-line additive primitive
(35 production, 104 tests, zero removals) encodes already verified graph
digest labels without authenticating a graph. Unused A2 proposal R2 does
not apply onto landed A1 and was not rerun. Round1 stopped at scope-strict

that venue was not rerun. The successor git-inits the apply scratch.
Round2 first-failure gates then passed helper_controls, baseline-apply,

Native interchange A3 transfer-record encoder is committed and pushed as
`e9b510270ca7131ef226c2246d3dc4af9ffa039c`. The 138-line additive
primitive (52 production, 86 tests, zero removals) encodes the
ten-field transfer record from already verified digest labels without
authenticating a graph. Operation endpoints are bound to the supplied
payload digests. Round1 first-failure gates then passed helper_controls,

Native interchange A4 frequency-permutation encoder is committed and
pushed as `3af70234223ab7db4e591a1f77240817b96c9953`. The 148-line
additive primitive (70 production, 78 tests, zero removals) encodes
closed eight-field frequency-permutation parameters from actual
stable-argsort labels without permuting arrays or authenticating a
parent. Unused R1 through R4 remain unused: R1 stopped at scoped

Native interchange A7 sorted-child factory is committed and pushed as
`fcaf6923dce7e6c86baf395b303d8b86cc804618`. The 347/1 primitive (162/1
production, 185 tests) binds a depth-1 NativeChainEvidence after
replaying native identity, encoding frequency permutation and export
declaration, and hashing the twelve-field child record. It does not
permute arrays, attach evidence, or dispatch owner validation.

Native interchange A8 owner dispatch is committed and pushed as

production, 165 tests) adds `require_native_materialization`, which
dispatches identity evidence through `require_native_identity` and
replays a depth-1 sorted child against an inverse-permuted unbound
parent. HealpixData accepts exact identity or chain evidence; existing
attachments are still preserved, not reissued. Round1 and round2 first
failures remain at scope-strict. Round3 first-failure gates then passed

Native interchange A9 frequency-sorted copy is committed and pushed as
`f00df14a40c7b140aeb4da40d988df3ec3a62719`. The 252/1 change (122/1
production, 130 tests) adds `copy_frequency_sorted_healpix`, which
copies ICRS RING Rayleigh-Jeans Stokes and frequency axes into stable
frequency order on a new unbound HealpixData without mutating the
parent. It does not attach evidence, pack a theta/phi tensor, wrap
pyradiosky, or replace the attached export refusal. Round1

production, 166 tests) adds `adapt_sorted_healpix_u_sign`, which
negates U once on an already frequency-sorted unbound HealpixData
while preserving I/Q/V, frequencies and physical IDs. It does not pack

production, 179 tests) adds `pack_sorted_theta_phi_stokes`, which
stacks already sign-adapted sorted I/Q/U/V into a locked `[4, F, N]`
`<f8` tensor on `SerializedNativePayload` and validates it through
`bind_serialized_native`. It does not wrap pyradiosky, write HDF5, or

Native interchange A12 pyradiosky wrap and E bind is committed and
pushed as `c8c4c7ae3d927359167a545dbd6a1be66cd68f82`. The 292/2 change
(135/2 production, 157 tests) adds `wrap_packed_theta_phi_stokes` and
`require_bound_theta_phi_endpoint`, which construct actual pyradiosky
1.1.0 from a packed `[4, F, N]` payload and re-read Stokes, axes and
headers so constructor changes refuse. It does not create a transfer
wrapper, write HDF5, or replace the attached export refusal. Round1

L1 cleanup source policy has both independent
ACCEPTs and root authentication of 139 members (3,897,293 bytes). The unexecuted
config-probe round1 was rejected for roster, resource-bound and failure-receipt
gaps. Unexecuted round2 repairs the roster and failure receipt but is rejected
for incomplete proxy-based hook inventory, copies preceding bounds, and child
setup outside cleanup protection. Both original reviews are retained in
`ci-collector-config-probe/round2/`. The subsequent CONFIG round4 source has
both independent ACCEPTs. Its 11 standalone controls pass on each supported
runtime, with frozen source/executable and installed-source checks before and
after (`ci-collector-config-controls/round1/`). Actual CONFIG round4 subsequently
ran once: both children and pytest returned zero, each with one command/configure/
unconfigure invocation and no observed Session, collection or runtest activity.
Post-main registrations, full global hooks, options, ini and distributions equal
pre-cleanup in both profiles; separately observed import-hook changes and warnings
remain retained. Both final independent reviews accept the exact execution in
`ci-collector-config-execution/round4/`. These are CONFIG-only observations, not
Session/sessionfinish, collection, full collector readiness or CI closure.

At root's reported CI observation on 9 September 2026, exact `25d5dc0` run
[34367163259](https://github.com/RRI-interferometry/RadioSim/actions/runs/34367163259)

## Subsequent bounded implementation and evidence checkpoints

The D36 table builder has independent acceptance for the pure, unwired fixed
registration declaration and arithmetic from authenticated derived records.
`d36-profile-registration/table-builder-round1/root-disposition.json` binds the
54-artifact manifest `91aaacb768667d4b7d251870e66148175543b225d5fc88ef0281821de2594af7`.
Both runtimes reproduce 148 historical formula controls and identical declarations;
36 synthetic controls pass on each. The completed four-certificate census observes
85-bit numerator/denominator maxima, which fit the unchanged 256-bit domain and
change no fixed proposed capacity term. Detailed schema owners are bound to the
exact retained inventory. This does not establish a generic hostile parser, reader
source-fit, applied profile/capacity, payload acquisition or scientific admission.

C1 instrument checkpoints are committed in the following sequence. Checkpoint 8
composes the reviewed primitives and connects instrument validation to the input
validator. Other C1 owners and the coupled schema work remain open.

| Checkpoint | Commit | Bounded result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `09e2b6f38863f5dbe721b75067854cb437fe1b90` | Test-only independent instrument/selection fixture and public-owner joins; 218 selected cases pass per runtime. |
| 2 | `272a2afa4978644ddc1f72f7d81cd38beebaae1c` | Exact native binary64 scalar/vector primitives; 45 focused cases pass per runtime. |
| 3 | `d1239bffcdc2abed1752e44db60e09dbb59756b5` | Ordered antenna identity, ENU, diameter and provenance primitive; 58 focused cases pass per runtime. |
| 4 | `74830bc5f30330a3bbf4124f33ef467447cf1f7c` | Outer instrument closure and original fingerprint primitive; 33 focused cases pass per runtime, retaining later geodesy obligations. |
| 5 | `59450dc83146fd6ea487afdb95a25e16fe43b385` | Exact original and rebuilt phase-site reconstruction; 34 focused cases pass per runtime. |
| 6 | `cc54a2c192bb6cb642be1429def1155c85da42f2` | Exact selection criteria, counts and ordered native baseline IDs; 32 focused cases pass per runtime. |
| 7 | `31305712742844678985636e4f3c1eb79ba9d91b` | Phase rows and original batched ENU rotations, with independent public-owner joins; 20 focused cases pass per runtime. |
| 8 | `5ac4a23594647be81f3c31347fb74eb3deb486fd` | Complete instrument composition and input-validator connection; 469 selected cases pass per runtime. |

The corresponding `c1-instrument-checkpoint{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}/round1/root-commit.json`
records bind reviewed patches, commit outcomes and preserved ambient changes.
Scoped strict diagnostics remain the same 367. Checkpoint 8 retains exact
reference predicate composition; 15 literal test variants are explicitly qualified
as predicate-equivalent coverage, not verbatim case replay. Its 469-case gates do
not constitute a full E gate, completed C1, or observation admission.

The independent C1 beam fixture is committed and pushed as
`637cc4309197cb28b6bc66d0df435e0a82da9cef`: 15 selected cases pass per runtime,
with the same 367 scoped strict diagnostics. Four public-family beam snapshots
join independent literal projections; the phase join uses the shared PointI
manifest, not four independently materialized phase manifests. This is test-only
preparation for the beam consumer. Exact evidence and the original stopped
sequence remain in `c1-beam-fixture-candidate/round2/` and `round1-stop/`.
The finite definition-only validator is now committed and pushed as
`93beba72d2ad9bc2919785374af5e6a457e729d1`: 61 selected cases pass per runtime,
with the same 367 scoped strict diagnostics. Two deliberate predicate mutations
produce the expected assertion failures with original functions restored. This
176-addition definition helper remains unwired. Its exact executed evidence is
in `c1-beam-definition-candidate/round1/`.
The finite handler primitive is now committed as
`732a853f980168e9912c76c1d749b40eee24b8d9`: all 99 selected case identities match
across both passing runtime gates, with the same 367 scoped strict diagnostics.
Its 234 additions include one type-only cast after the existing row guard;
original 367-to-369 typing and packaging-collision stops remain preserved in
`c1-beam-handler-candidate/`. Final evidence is in `round2-authored/`.
The handler remains unwired for assignment and instrument/phase joins.
Scientific beam composition without those joins is now committed at
`d94904dacfcb1f8cfc3dc6951fefc5ccc814ba89`. Phase joins, public-validator
wiring, remaining C1 owners, numerical beam qualification and admission
remain pending.

The private, unwired native payload codec is committed at
`5ed697ffdfe86efd57c349f0384c6adddfe669a6`. Identity tests at
`ac08dd3262e9b3e87926584cafde4b1d937d83a4`, constructor-aware layout tests at
`52faa0e49340024950ea73113f91d975cfaa086f`, and hostile-input tests at
`47a6b4843c437fe8dc7b6d814f79176295cd87ca` extend its finite coverage. That checkpoint's
focused module passes 57 cases on each runtime with zero scoped strict diagnostics.
These controls distinguish stored values, signed zero, aliases, order and endian
representations, and reject invalid owned metadata. They do not wire loaders,
materialize maps, establish physical equivalence or grant public M4 support.
Test-only scratch instrumentation `be541fb1c62575a7fd8e4fbf867e2c7826cee9fb`
extends that module to 59 passing cases per runtime. Transparent iterator/hash
observers establish finite traversal and conservative parent-capacity accounting
for the declared sparse/dense fixtures; they do not prove hidden native allocation,
all layouts or RSS. Exact records reside under
`m4-native-value-binding-code/round2/` and
`m4-native-binding-{identities,layout,hostile,scratch}/round1/`.

The private canonical stored-native identity helper
`39c1f2f92f8e8d760fff2a88b16363b42750e052` adds a twelve-field record, fixed stored
operation and immutable byte sidecars. Three focused cases pass per runtime,
including independent-oracle coverage, with zero scoped strict diagnostics. It
certifies no earlier conversion history and changes no public owner or loader.
Test-only `e58613b3a3b142f9ab96bfb85261f11285db8e04` extends the module to 18
passing cases per runtime, covering corrupted records/sidecars, stale backing
aliases and null/zero/empty domains. Test-only
`c56003e3c4b8268cd39a67fe13c340769feecd34` extends the module to 21 passing cases
per runtime with zero scoped strict diagnostics: exact profile/frame/receipt types
and actual shared-owner preservation across success, validation and refusal.
Subsequent B1 scanner controls are recorded below. Scope and records
are retained in `m4-native-identity-materialization-code/round1/`,
`m4-native-identity-hostile-tests/round1/` and `m4-native-identity-types/round1/`.
Typed schema A is committed and pushed as
`1de8e912d5357c2bb1ac00e0a199b491919797f3`, with both applied-candidate reviews
accepted. Its 22 cases pass per runtime, with zero scoped strict diagnostics and
four fresh import-order proofs. Public value constructors remain unvalidated;
typed declarations and the exact conversion-context join do not attach owners,
complete scanner controls or grant public scientific support. Evidence is retained
in `m4-native-materialization-schema-A-candidate/round1/`. Native B1 scanner
controls are committed and pushed as `ca7494a6c7c20a590fdad364646fb3f0fa22934b`,
with both independent reviews accepted: 25 cases pass per runtime and scoped
strict diagnostics remain zero. Contiguous/strided late-U exposure and the causal
cleanup control establish finite chunk/mask observations, not C allocation or RSS
bounds. B2 early-return, absent/empty and nonfinite-before-entry controls are
committed and pushed as `e30b9ff1c236967c6218f8815d3154adda785a08`: 30 cases
pass per runtime with zero scoped strict diagnostics. B1's original static stops
remain under `m4-native-identity-linear-scan-candidate/round1/`; B2 evidence is in
`m4-native-identity-linear-scan-B2-candidate/round1/`.

Native owner attachment is committed and pushed as
`91e066eb79e58c3348d3bdee10802db9fe9ee95a`. Typed canonical evidence and frame
now join normalized stored values and final SkyModel context; identical
replacements preserve complete receipts, while reviewed drop/reissue and stale
endpoint paths refuse. Verification passes 27 focused and 26 existing regression
cases per runtime, plus four fresh import-order probes; scoped strict retains the
same 97 diagnostics. Callers must exclude mutation/rebinding through all aliases
throughout validation and publication; this does not establish concurrent snapshot
safety. Hostile owner tests are committed and pushed at
`d1e281f8c8ed107783007747b7ce667d5c805b27`: 46 cases pass per runtime
(14 new, two basic owner, 30 materialization), with zero new-file strict diagnostics.
The preparation-only missing-conftest stop and final reviewed evidence remain in
`m4-native-owner-hostile-candidate/{round1,round2}/`.
Sky preparation preservation is now committed and pushed as
`25d5dc07f1730bbb133175e217e5502a55551ee3`. `prepare_sky_model` revalidates
attached evidence against the actual input context and preserves unchanged
single-model returns, including existing hybrid point payloads. It refuses
attached combinations or map-to-point conversion until child-materialization
evidence exists; lossy/disjointness options do not authorize dropping identity.
Raw unbound models keep their prior behavior and gain no inferred convention.
The entire call retains the caller's alias-exclusion precondition. The selected
four-module regression set plus four raw combine/conversion nodes passes 83
cases per runtime. Scoped static evidence is explicitly reused from the passed
113-to-113 comparison, with no fresh-static claim. Original strict/fixture and
unguarded-spawn stops remain under `m4-native-prepare-consumer-candidate/`; final
round3 preserves the guarded runner and exact source. Cache/export, other fresh
construction and lower-level operations, loader canonicalization and public
native m-mode qualification remain separate.
The original strict stop and final evidence are in
`m4-native-owner-candidate/{round1,round2}/`. Root records
`native-schema-A-commit.json`, `ci-request-commit.json` and
`cleanup-policy-auth.json` under `output/verification/root-continuation-20260908/`
bind the landed commits and separate L1 source-policy disposition.

D35 reader construction remains source preparation. The original discovery and
call-transport qualification stops remain in
`d35-profile-reader-construction-preparation/`. The subsequent 96-file/runtime
allowance is solely a finite source-discovery grant (2 MiB/file, 32 MiB/runtime),
not construction execution or a proof of W=1280. The prepared four-slot amendment
and allocation-source work have not produced an accepted aggregate lifetime fit.
The accepted predecessor source-only 1304-byte subset against W=1280 remains in
`d35-profile-reader-construction-preparation/round3-prepersistent-counterbound-stop/`.
The subsequent two-method source amendment and compile-only census have two
independent ACCEPTs for an incomplete-owner STOP: under the operative retain-W
fallback, the conditional subset is 1368 bytes against W=1280. An exact accepted
post-P owner transfer remains unproved. This result is specific to the qualified
CPython 3.11 first instance; it is neither a measured allocation/RSS peak, a
Python 3.12 instance bound nor a complete upper proof. Its records are in
`d35-profile-reader-charge-construction-preparation/round1-owner-stop/`.
Later layout and controller-flow work has not established construction fit.
The predecessor layout compile-only census yielded a positive-path subtotal of
1288 bytes on py312 against W=1280 (default's 1280 was not a fit proof), retained
in `d35-profile-reader-layout-construction-preparation/round1-owner-stop/`.
The controller-flow option has two independent ACCEPTs for a conditional
source-design STOP: zero-stack error-overlap subsets are 1344 bytes on default
and 1352 on py312 against W=1280, under the stated retained-binding, method-domain
and retain-W conditions. Its admitted-capacity witness is not demonstrated to
belong to the unchanged 148-case roster. These are neither measured peaks nor
failed executions of that roster. The diagnostic patch is not an approved W
repair. Exact records are in `d35-profile-reader-controller-flow-options/round1/`;
predecessor stops remain unchanged.

The later phase-separation option also has an accepted, qualified source-only
STOP: post-D lower subsets are 1312 bytes on default and 1320 on py312 against
W=1280, already excluding the optional lexical cell body. Unlike the preceding
capacity-refusal witness, this is an existing case's positive acquisition setup
before its raw-constructor fault is armed. No case was executed. The conclusion
retains the current controller/helper-frame attribution and qualified source
premises; it is neither a measured peak nor algorithm-independent impossibility.
Root disposition binds manifest
`e9b6980d4ad47a2537335e8cc8d742900c00b013d3838f106d7e917bd7b8e66e`
in `d35-profile-reader-phase-separation-plan/round1/`. A coordinated nonrecursive
lexical/detachment design with complete positive/error proof, or a separately
reviewed traversal-owner contract, remains the next source decision. No
implementation, compilation or runtime release follows from this STOP. Raw496,
P/D formulas, pair caps and the 148-case roster remain unchanged; no actual
capture profile has been acquired by this reader.

FITPACK execution is accepted only for four finite public-constructor observations
and four Python pre-native refusals across the two recorded environments. Maximum
input z size was 70 elements; returned base payload sizes were 96 and 744 bytes in
each runtime. `m4-fitpack-native-execution/round1/root-disposition.json` binds
manifest `5251316c4e7d53f0a91f5fc2ddc5c857c35ed5b258d1bd1e76c11e07a1cc5449`.
The original RECORD nonjoins remain preserved. This supplies neither an all-size
workspace/ABI/allocator/RSS proof nor numerical enclosure, production grant or M4
admission. No historical paragraph, failed attempt or original identity above is
reclassified by these later bounded outcomes.
